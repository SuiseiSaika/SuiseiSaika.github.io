## Multi-Camera Grading System (YOLO-based)

#### Description
Developed a real-time grading pipeline integrating multi-camera input, oriented bounding box detection, segmentation, multi-process dataflow, and rule-based decision logic.  
Optimized inference on Jetson Orin NX with TensorRT to achieve stable and low-latency performance.

## Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering (RAG)

#### Description
Built a retrieval-augmented QA pipeline combining embedding models, ChromaDB retrieval, MMR selection, and multiple open-source LLMs.  
Experimented with Llama, Gemma, and Phi models using unified prompt templates for consistent evaluation.

## Large Language Model Re-ranking for Misconception Detection (Kaggle)

#### Description
Implemented an LLM-based re-ranking system using Qwen2.5-32B Instruct (AWQ) deployed with vLLM.  
Designed constrained decoding and scoring mechanisms to refine multiple-choice prediction reliability.

---

## BERT-Based Multi-Output Learning

#### Description
Constructed a multi-output architecture using BERT to simultaneously predict regression and classification targets.  
Designed task-specific preprocessing workflows and explored loss balancing strategies.

---

## Sequence Modeling for Arithmetic Expressions

#### Description
Trained seq2seq and LSTM-based models to interpret arithmetic expressions as structured sequences.  
Built a tokenization and dataset generation pipeline to evaluate model generalization.

---

## Language-Guided Image Anomaly Detection

#### Description
Explored a language-conditioned feature alignment method combining image encodings, text prompts, and a mask estimation branch.  
Investigated domain-shift robustness using language-guided anomaly localization.
